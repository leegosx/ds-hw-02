## Overview
This project comprises three parts, each focusing on using the Pandas library for data analysis and visualization. The work with data includes reading, cleaning, processing, and visualizing using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Each part demonstrates different aspects of data handling and visualization.

### Part 1: Introduction to Pandas
- **Task**: Analysis of birth rate data in regions of Ukraine.
- **Objective**: Get acquainted with basic Pandas functions, including data reading, dataframe information output, handling missing values, and basic statistical computations.

### Part 2: File Analysis
- **Task**: Analysis of developer survey results.
- **Objective**: Expand skills in Pandas, including data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, and saving results to a file.

### Part 3: Kaggle Dataset Analysis
- **Task**: Analysis of Amazon bestseller data.
- **Objective**: Apply advanced Pandas techniques for data grouping, aggregation, and answering specific questions. Also included is data analysis and visualization.

## Data Visualization
For each part, 3 to 5 different types of graphs (bar charts, line graphs, histograms, etc.) are added using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Each graph is uniquely styled, effectively presenting the analyzed data.

## Technical Details
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Directive**: `%matplotlib inline` used for embedding graphs in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data processing and analysis, from basic usage of Pandas to advanced functions and visualization. Each part of the project is aimed at developing skills in handling real-world data, from raw data processing to insightful visualizations.
